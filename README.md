## More about me
I worked on both sides in IT: business and development. I even used to run my own small dev team with web dev services. 
I finally found what truly makes me happy and I focused on full stack development in JavaScript.

I enjoy problem solving, creating RESTful APIs, work on backend with Node JS and Express. 
I'm also passionate about UI as well. 
As a professional marketer in past I know how innovative and yet usable and light interfaces are important for success of the product.

🥇 I'm ambitious, collaborative and quick learning person!
